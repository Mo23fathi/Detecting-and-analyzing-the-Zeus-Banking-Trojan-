# Detecting-and-analyzing-the-Zeus-Banking-Trojan
## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to **detect and analyze the Zeus Banking Trojan** using various tools and techniques, including malware simulation, network monitoring, memory analysis, and signature-based detection.

## **Tools and Techniques**
- **Suricata**: Network traffic monitoring and detection.
- **Splunk**: Centralized log analysis and visualizations.
- **Volatility**: Memory analysis.
- **YARA**: Signature-based detection.
- **VM Environment**: Safe malware execution.

## ** [1]  Steps to Implement suricata **

### 1. **Simulate Malware Execution**
- Use **Wireshark** to monitor traffic and identify malicious connections and DNS requests.
- Set up a virtual machine (VM) to safely run malware.
- Download the Zeus Trojan sample from [theZoo repository](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malware/Binaries/ZeusBankingVersion_26Nov2013).
- Execute the malware within the VM to observe its behavior.

### 2. **Using  the default rules to detect common threats.(the default rule obtained from: https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata/ )**
And here is the output:

### 3. **Capture IOC Information**
- From **Wireshark**, identify:
  - Malicious IP addresses the Trojan connects to.
  - DNS requests made by the Trojan.

- Example Findings:
  - Malicious IP: `85.114.128.127`
  - Malicious Domain: `fpdownload.macromedia.com`
- Search for the malware's hash in public analysis tools (e.g., **ANY.RUN**) to confirm Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
  - File Hash (SHA256): `4644b5fb10fb84c0d47bec4b5a48d5e60165e8ae2130fca5c055633aaad73162`
  - Additional Malicious IP: `23.213.170.81`
 Why we should Block the IP 85.114.128.127?
The IP belongs to a German hosting company called Fastwebserver.de.
It is not marked as "malicious" on major security websites.
Why it could be suspicious:

the DNS server is not part of your approved list (like Google 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare 1.1.1.1), traffic to it might mean:
Malware or viruses are using this server.
Data is being secretly sent out (DNS tunneling).

### 4. **Write Suricata Rules for Detection and Blocking**
Based on the identified IOCs, the following **Suricata rules** were created to detect and block malicious activity:

### 5. ** here is sample of the log file  after adding the rules to the suricata  and running the trojan: **

## ** [2]  Integrate with Splunk **

### 1. **Ingest Suricata logs to Splunk**

- After forwarding the `eve.json` file which contains detailed structured information about various events detected by Suricata
  ![2024-12-15 18_54_28-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b17af2-fe3e-41b5-b1b7-c59869cb8c23)

- Add Suricata logs as a data source in Splunk:
  - Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Inputs** > **Files & Directories**.
  - Add the directory where Suricata logs are stored (e.g., C:\Users\abdoo\Desktop\Suricata\logs\eve.json).
    ![2024-12-15 18_56_51-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47fde0a5-f1ac-43f8-b13f-ccd58aa8f4ca)
  - Assign an appropriate source type, which is JSON
    ![2024-12-15 18_57_04-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1b8f079-ac2b-4842-9ddd-6242c77f67bf)
  - Choose the destination index (e.g., `suricata_logs`).
    ![2024-12-15 18_57_58-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b8c802-bba2-433e-b15e-12362784558d)
  - Validate and Search Logs in Splunk:
    ![2024-12-15 18_59_09-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38723103-3880-4cde-aedc-72d2ec4ba913)

  


### 2. **Ingest System Logs**
- Add Windows Event Logs as a Data Input:
  - Go to **Settings** > **Data Inputs** > **Local Event Logs**.
  - Add the following logs:
    - Application
    - Security
    - System
      ![2024-12-15 19_04_38-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc087c93-bc30-407f-a2e3-113c47484013)
  - Assign them to a new index: `windows_logs`.
  - Verify Ingestion:

- to Link network anomalies with system activity (e.g., file system changes, process creation):
  ![2024-12-16 00_23_24-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/636b2853-1c08-41ac-850b-7f4c04ee381d)

### 4. ** Creating visual dashboards in Splunk to track malicious activity **

![2024-12-15 19_28_42-Windows 10 x64 - VMware Workstation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1938965-324d-49f4-83b8-b77189079594)

## ** [3]  Steps to Implement Volatility **
### 1.First we will download our vm  and python 3 and volatility And start scanning the operating system info and it's process

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6658858-670d-4434-8e85-cbd9d39bbbe2)

### 2.There is nothing malicious so we will check the connections

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4677be71-7896-451e-844d-adacd6d157b7)

### 3.we found only one file and we checked its path and we found nothing and now we will check the code if it's injected and we found that there is a mz header and we dumped it but we also found nothing

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d7e12c8-1684-4227-b233-962ee44dfcee)


### 4.we will try to dump the section of the memory we think is injected and it was actually malicious

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d141bad8-ab88-421d-bc3b-f0ae132be725)


### 5.we will check the most used mechanisms by malwares and we will find that this pid has a handle on another exe and we found that is a winlogon.exe

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4003d8a-23a0-4ec4-a2bc-648e126a23a8)

### 6.Now we will check if itâ€™s injected and we will dump it and check it and we find that is malicious

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b043bef7-c85e-41c7-989a-4d8602af09d8)


### 7.We will check the mutants we find _AVIRA_2109 which looks suspicious and we will search for simillars and we found another one

## ** [4]  Steps to Implement yara rules **
### 1. ** To identify YARA rules for the Zeus Trojan,  I searched the **Open Threat Exchange ( websites that share threats  ) (example: OTX)  ** website for publicly available signatures. The following rule was obtained from [OTX YARA Database (https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/yara/932be60a5873010929bbf0751f9934016f06c640): **

### 2. ** here is output of the yara rules  after  running the yara rule on the malware file: **

### 3. ** here is output of the yara rules  after  running the same yara rule on the memory dump file of the virtual machine: **
