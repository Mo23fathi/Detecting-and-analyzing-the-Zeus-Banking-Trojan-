# Detecting-and-analyzing-the-Zeus-Banking-Trojan
## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to **detect and analyze the Zeus Banking Trojan** using various tools and techniques, including malware simulation, network monitoring, memory analysis, and signature-based detection.

## **Tools and Techniques**
- **Suricata**: Network traffic monitoring and detection.
- **Splunk**: Centralized log analysis and visualizations.
- **Volatility**: Memory analysis.
- **YARA**: Signature-based detection.
- **VM Environment**: Safe malware execution.

## ** [1]  Steps to Implement suricata **

### 1. **Simulate Malware Execution**
- Use **Wireshark** to monitor traffic and identify malicious connections and DNS requests.
- Set up a virtual machine (VM) to safely run malware.
- Download the Zeus Trojan sample from [theZoo repository](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malware/Binaries/ZeusBankingVersion_26Nov2013).
- Execute the malware within the VM to observe its behavior.

### 2. **Capture IOC Information**
- From **Wireshark**, identify:
  - Malicious IP addresses the Trojan connects to.
  - DNS requests made by the Trojan.

- Example Findings:
  - Malicious IP: `85.114.128.127`
  - Malicious Domain: `fpdownload.macromedia.com`
- Search for the malware's hash in public analysis tools (e.g., **ANY.RUN**) to confirm Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
  - File Hash (SHA256): `4644b5fb10fb84c0d47bec4b5a48d5e60165e8ae2130fca5c055633aaad73162`
  - Additional Malicious IP: `23.213.170.81`
 Why we should Block the IP 85.114.128.127?
The IP belongs to a German hosting company called Fastwebserver.de.
It is not marked as "malicious" on major security websites.
Why it could be suspicious:

the DNS server is not part of your approved list (like Google 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare 1.1.1.1), traffic to it might mean:
Malware or viruses are using this server.
Data is being secretly sent out (DNS tunneling).

### 3. **Write Suricata Rules for Detection and Blocking**
Based on the identified IOCs, the following **Suricata rules** were created to detect and block malicious activity:

### 4. ** here is sample of the log file  after adding the rules to the suricata  and running the trojan: **

## ** [3]  Steps to Implement Volatility **
### 1.First we will download our vm  and python 3 and volatility And start scanning the operating system info and it's process

### 2.There is nothing malicious so we will check the connections

### 3.we found only one file and we checked its path and we found nothing and now we will check the code if it's injected and we found that there is a mz header and we dumped it but we also found nothing

### 4.we will try to dump the section of the memory we think is injected and it was actually malicious

### 5.we will check the most used mechanisms by malwares and we will find that this pid has a handle on another exe and we found that is a winlogon.exe

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4003d8a-23a0-4ec4-a2bc-648e126a23a8)

### 6.Now we will check if itâ€™s injected and we will dump it and check it and we find that is malicious

### 7.We will check the mutants we find _AVIRA_2109 which looks suspicious and we will search for simillars and we found another one

## ** [4]  Steps to Implement yara rules **
### 1. ** To identify YARA rules for the Zeus Trojan,  I searched the **Open Threat Exchange ( websites that share threats  ) (example: OTX)  ** website for publicly available signatures. The following rule was obtained from [OTX YARA Database (https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/yara/1bee7c83ba67483bfb34ad5fe6b08c7413ce2e00): **

### 2. ** here is output of the yara rules  after  running the yara rule on the malware file: **

### 3. ** here is output of the yara rules  after  running the same yara rule on the memory dump file of the virtual machine: **
